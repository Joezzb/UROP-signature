# UROP-signature

Signature method is a technique which extracts features from data stream. In simple words, it is the set of mutiple integral of the multi-dimensional data stream. Base on this idea, Rough path theory develops many useful properties, which play an important role in some mathematical proof.

Due to poor condition of my personal computer at that time, image was compressed to 50x50. Although the experiment produced a opposit result against the paper'Sparse arrays of signatures for online character recognition',the experiment was not representative enough to argue against the original paper and many limitation was not mentioned in the output file. More experiment on different dataset need to be done to verify the effectiveness of signature method.

The pendigit data used is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pen-Based+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits
